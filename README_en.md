# URL-Geolocation

## Description
URL-Geolocation is a tool designed to provide geolocation information when a generated URL is opened. It allows you to create a URL with options to input your email and a message, and upon opening the URL, it notifies you with the geolocation information.

**Note:** The geolocation functionality is currently disabled as the tool operates in a closed environment. To enable it, you need to set up your own domain and activate the message mode.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kether369/URL-Geolocation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd URL-Geolocation
    ```

3. (Additional setup steps if required, e.g., configuring domains)

4. Run the tool:
    ```bash
    python3 geolocalizacion.py
    ```

The tool is now installed and ready to use.

## Usage

1. Create a URL with geolocation options by following the tool's prompts.

2. Open the generated URL in a web browser.

3. Receive geolocation information and notifications based on the configured settings.

## Configuration (if necessary)

If you want to enable geolocation and message mode, follow these additional steps:

1. Set up your own domain.

2. Activate message mode in the tool's configuration.
